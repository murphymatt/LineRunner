[Alex, Judge 1, Judge 2, Judge 3, Matt]
Alex: So this is our project, Line Runner.
Judge 1: Very neat.
Judge 2: This is next level, yo.
Judge 3: Do you want a job?
Matt: Woah woah. One at a time please. We only support one character speaking at a time.
Judge 1: How much does that restrict your use?
Alex: Actually not that much. There are very few scripts that make use of multiple characters speaking at the same time.
Judge 2: How did you come up with this?
Matt: We scrapped three other ideas before this, and Alex is in a play right now, so...
Alex: So it just made sense.
Judge 3: Let me hire you.
Matt: Okay.
